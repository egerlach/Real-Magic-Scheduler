<h1>Recent Updates</h1>
<ul>
  <li>The profile page now says Primary/Secondary/Suspended. Suspended means you cannot go out on shift because you still need to do a shift test, or your certs are not on file. Contact the scheduler for more details</li>
  <li>Secondaries can now take the primary slot for FnP shifts, since FnP shifts do not require a primary responder to be present</li>
</ul>
