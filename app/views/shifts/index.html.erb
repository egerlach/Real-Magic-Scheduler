<h1>Shifts</h1>
<p>You will only be able to take shifts which you meet the criteria for. This means that secondary responders cannot take primary shifts. Furthermore, once you have reached the quota for your hours you will not be able to take shifts until 48 hours before they begin. You can see a report of your hours and shifts by clicking "profile" in the navigation bar.</p>
