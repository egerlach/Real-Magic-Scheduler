<h1>Shifts</h1>
<p>You will only be able to take shifts which you meet the criteria for. A shift becomes "critical" 7 days before it begins. The restrictions are...</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you are suspended you cannot take any shifts</li>
  <li>You cannot take a shift that conflicts with another shift you already have</li>
  <li>If you are a secondary you cannot take a primary shift (except FnP)</li>
  <li>If you are a primary you cannot take a secondary shift until it is critical (except FnP)</li>
  <li>If your total hours (past + future) meet the quota you cannot take a shift until it is critical</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see a report of your hours and shifts by clicking "profile" in the navigation bar.</p>
<p>If a shift changes or is cancelled, those affected will be notified by telephone or e-mail and details will be posted here within 24 hours of the shift. If you notice any errors, please contact the director of scheduling ASAP.</p>
